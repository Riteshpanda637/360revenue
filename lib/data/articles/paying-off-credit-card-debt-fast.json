The key was consistency and never missing a payment.</p>\n      \n      <h2>Resources</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li><a href=\"https://unbury.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unbury.us: Debt Payoff Calculator</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YNAB: Budgeting for Debt Payoff</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"/keywords/debt%20management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Debt Management Guide</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"/keywords/credit%20cards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Credit Card Resources</a></li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h2>About the Author</h2>\n      <p><strong>Lisa Park</strong> is a debt counselor and financial educator who has helped clients pay off over $2 million in consumer debt.
